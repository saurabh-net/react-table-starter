This is a starter kit based on the popular react-table project hosted at https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table.

There are simple examples of **client-side pagination**, **sorting**, and multiple kinds of **filters**. It is also integrated with **Bootstrap** and **React-Select**.

There's a global fuzzy filter across all the fields, a multi-field select filter, and per-column filters.

You can also hide columns or rearrange them.

Most of the code is a rehash of Tanner's existing examples, with the intent of getting users to adopt the library quickly.
