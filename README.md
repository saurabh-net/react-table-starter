This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a starter kit based on the popular react-table project hosted at https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table.

There are simple examples of client-side pagination, sorting, and multiple kinds of filters.

There's a global fuzzy filter across all the fields, a multi-field select filter, and per-column filters.

You can also hide columns or rearrange them.

Most of the code is a rehash of Tanner's existing examples, integrated with React-Bootstrap and React-Select  so that one can use the library quickly.
